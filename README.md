# Chat with ChatGPT

This is a simple application that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3 API, allowing users to interact with ChatGPT through a web interface. The app allows users to send messages to ChatGPT and receive responses in real-time.

### Features:

- **Customizable Chatbot**: Easily modify the behavior of the chatbot for various use cases.
- **Flask Framework**: Built using Flask for easy deployment and customization.

### Files:
- **`app.py`**: The main Python file containing the Flask backend logic to interact with the ChatGPT API and serve the web application.
- **`templates/`**: Contains HTML files for rendering the user interface.
  
### Requirements:
To run this project, you need to have Python and pip installed, as well as a few dependencies.
